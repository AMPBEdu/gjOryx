# jOryx

Created by Furyhunter <furyhunter600@gmail.com>

A Realm of the Mad God client. For client version 122.3.2.

Please visit my twitter, @Furyhunter and my tumblr furyhunter.tumblr.com for
updates pertaining to the project! Special thanks goes to /r/RotMG on reddit
and my friends in My Little Godslayers for giving me the support to make this
a reality.

## Requirements

Please note that these requirements are not exact; no extensive testing has
been done to ensure that the program operates across several configurations.

 * Dual Core processor
 * 512MiB free memory
 * Hardware-accelerated OpenGL 1.1 support (mandatory)
 * Sun Java Standard Edition 6

## How to use (player)

Simply run the Windows executable or Linux shell script depending on your OS.
If you're on OSX, just click the jar file (this does not have the same run
parameters as the launchers, so you will probably experience stuttering and
memory problems).

## How to use (developer)

If you're not a developer, please download a distribution package from
https://github.com/Furyhunter/jOryx/downloads instead of pulling the source.

Simple run the following command in a terminal if you are compiling outside of
Eclipse:

  ant build

Use the following for more information from the build script:

  ant -projecthelp

You need the Java Development Kit installed and on the PATH, and Ant available
on the path, in order to build without Eclipse.

If using Eclipse, import the project using the project import wizard in Eclipse.
Open the Ant view (Window -> Show View -> Ant) and drag the build.xml into the
view. Make a run configuration that starts com.joryx.JOryx with the JVM param
-XX:UseConcMarkSweepGC. Optionally, attach jme-src.zip to each of the jME3-*.jar
files for javadoc lookup in the code.

Non-client specific code (from oryx-hates-java) is still found in the same
package, however the two projects have merged into a single entity as they were
converging paths in development anyway.

## Change log

Version 0.3.0 (in progress):

 * Now available under GPLv3 license. Please contribute!
 * Update to retail client 122.3.2
 * Unlocked access to world portals.
 * Sound effects have been added.
 * Image handling has been rewritten but has not been extensively tested on
   systems without non-power of 2 texture support.
 * Work in progress...

Version 0.2.0:

 * OpenGL 1.1 support (consequently breaking OpenGL 2, 1.1 is forced for all
   devices for now until a later version)
 * Dropped animation shaders in favor of UV-map system
 * Redesigned chat UI to be less intrusive.
 * You may now mouse over any object to read its health, type number and name
 * Portals to other realms work, but combat areas are disabled until projectile
   implementation is complete. (They work for the most part!)
 * Stuttering largely eliminated for multicore systems. Please add the argument
   -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC if running the jar directly (Linux, OSX)
 * You can now relogin correctly after being disconnected.

Version Alpha 1:

 * Initial public release
